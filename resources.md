## The U.S. Data Federation intends to share best practices around federated data efforts, including guides and repeatable processes around data governance, organizational coordination, and standards development in federated environments.

### U.S. Data Federation Framework

This [framework](/us-data-federation-framework/) is the output of Phase 1 of our work and is based on interviews conducted with representatives of successful federated data projects and other data experts. It includes both a draft maturity model for evaluating data efforts and a playbook of learnings for anyone undertaking this type of project.
