## The U.S. Data Federation wants to document and share best practices around federated data efforts. These resources are intended to include guides and repeatable processes around data governance, organizational coordination, and standards development in federated environments.

### U.S. Data Federation Framework

This [framework](/us-data-federation-framework/) is the output of Phase 1 of our work and is based on interviews conducted with representatives of successful federated data projects and other data experts. It includes both a draft maturity model for evaluating data efforts and a playbook of learnings for anyone undertaking this type of project.
