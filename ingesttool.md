## The Federated Data Ingest Tool 

The Federated Data Ingest Tool is an early prototype.  The data ingest tool allows managers to create a data schema that users can then easily upload and validate data against, correcting any errors as they go. 

The Ingest Tool can be built into a GUI interface or operate behind the scenes via an API.  The tool will ingest a file, compare the file to a set of customizable validation rules, and return errors to the user to fix before submitting a final file for review.  The tool can also help agencies verify larger, aggregated datasets containing submissions from a number of external parties.
