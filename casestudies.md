# Office of Management and Budget

OMB needs a better way to share audit findings of federal grant dollars with federal agencies.   The current legacy system dates from the 1990s, and there was a desire to improve the way in which data about grants are shared amongst government agencies.  OMB ultimately wants agencies to work together to coordinate audit resolution processes while increasing transparency.

# U.S. Department of Agriculture

USDA wants to start small and build out a federated data service with just one form, starting with data on school lunch programs collected at the school district.  The USDA wants to make it easier to report and validate these data in real-time.  The tool will help validate data as it is entered, starting with a pilot across a couple states.

The tool is intended for:

- Government employees that manage projects directly and need easy, free-to-use tools for data ingestion and validation, supported by a best practices playbook; and
- Policy-makers who write or respond to requirements involving the cultivation and aggregation of data from multiple sources.  Lawmakers that need guidance on how data ingestion tools can be utilized to meet requirements.
