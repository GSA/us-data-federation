OMB needs a better way to share audit findings of federal grant dollars with federal agencies.   The current legacy system dates from the 1990s, and there was a desire to improve the way in which data about grants are shared amongst government agencies.  OMB ultimately wants agencies to work together to coordinate audit resolution processes while increasing transparency.

The FNS-742 Verification Summary Report (or 742) is an OMB-approved form that collects information from all School Food Authorities (SFAs) that participate in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast programs on certification and verification outcomes. These data are reported annually by SFAs to their State Agency, which are then submitted to the USDA’s Food & Nutrition Service (FNS). The 742 is FNS’ main source of administrative data for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs and it is one of the primary data sets that USDA uses in its work to identify and examine potential process improvements in the Programs, as well as provide technical assistance to Congress in the legislative process. 

While there are a number of simple, logic-based data validation checks already contained in the system through which FNS accepts 742 data submissions (called FPRS), the current checks do not capture all potentially identifiable errors. As a result, the dataset contains a large number of discrepancies that undermine the quality of any subsequent analyses. Additionally, the current process by which the data is submitted and validated involves a lot of manual processing and communication between SFAs, States and FNS, which is both slow and burdensome.

To address these two problems, USDA first developed a more robust series of edit checks that identify additional errors in the data. USDA understands its responsibility to limit the burden of compliance with its own rules on its State and local partners. In this project, the agency recognized an opportunity to work within and complement an existing data collection process. The goal is to provide data validation to SFAs to improve data quality while making it easier to report by providing real-time validation feedback directly to SFAs. The data service will contain the comprehensive set of data validation checks, and will be communicated through the State systems SFAs already know and use regularly – the idea is that they will not even be aware of the work the data service is performing in the background.

USDA plans to pilot the data service in several states.
