The Building & Land Development Specification (BLDS) is a standard for sharing open data on building and construction permits issued by municipal governments.

BLDS (pronounced "Builds") is a collaborative effort by civic technology companies, governments and other interested parties to create a shared data specification for building and construction permit data. This is part of a much broader effort to create shared standards for the open data being released by state, county and municipal governments across the country.
