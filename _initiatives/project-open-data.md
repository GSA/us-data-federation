Project Open Data provides the implementation guide and associated resources for the Federal Executive Order on open data and data management, [M-13-13](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/) "Managing Information as an Asset," including the standardized metadata schema required for all CFO Act agencies to publish the enterprise data inventories. 

The [Project Open Data Metadata Schema](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) is a JSON-based implementation of the [W3C DCAT vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/). This standard is currently implemented by multiple data catalog platforms as well as state and local governments.
