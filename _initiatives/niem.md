NIEM—the National Information Exchange Model—is a community-driven, standards-based approach to exchanging information.

All 50 states and the majority of federal agencies are using (at varying levels of maturity) or considering using NIEM. It is a consistent starting point—which includes a data model, governance, training, tools, technical support services, and an active community—that assists users in adopting a standards-based approach to exchanging data.
