###NIEM—the National Information Exchange Model—is a community-driven, standards-based approach to exchanging information. 

NIEM is a common vocabulary that enables efficient information exchange across diverse public and private organizations. Rather than starting from scratch, NIEM can save time, resources, and money by providing consistent, reusable data terms and definitions, and repeatable processes. 

NIEM allows all kinds of organizations to connect with each other and focus on what matters most – solving problems, reducing risks, and advancing even the most complex missions. Today all 50 states and many federal agencies are using (at varying levels of maturity) or considering using NIEM. The benefits of NIEM have also extended to Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Asia.

###Looking to learn more or get involved? 

* Download the current release, [NIEM 3.2] (https://release.niem.gov/).
* What is NIEM? [Learn more about NIEM] (https://www.niem.gov/about-niem).
* Visit [NIEM’s TechHub] (https://www.niem.gov/techhub), the entry point for technical information about NIEM, including deep-dives on the NIEM reference model and developer resources.
* Check out [what NIEM is doing with JSON] (https://www.niem.gov/techhub/json), including [initial guidance for using JSON-LD] (http://niem.github.io/json/guidance/) with NIEM. Have comments or suggestions on the use of JSON-LD and/or JSON Schema? The program is interested in hearing feedback on this guidance, as well as any insights you may have on using JSON with NIEM overall. Email information@niem.gov. 
* Explore [NIEM-UML] (https://www.niem.gov/techhub/niem-uml), an additional way to create NIEM-based information exchanges. The NIEM Unified Modeling Language (UML) Profile is based on the Object Management Group’s international Model Driven Architecture standards.
* [Integrate geospatial] (https://www.niem.gov/techhub/geospatial-integration) elements and capabilities into your exchange. NIEM developed geospatial exchange capabilities that leverage Geography Markup Language (GML) standards established by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). By combining NIEM with GML, mission partners benefit from shared access to the common operating data and services used within these geospatial systems.
* Jumpstart exchange development by using the [IEPD Starter Kit] (http://niem.github.io/iepd-starter-kit/).
* Access the beta1 version of the [NIEM open source Java Binding Tool] (https://github.com/NIEM/IEPD-Java-Bindings). Note the Java Binding Tool does not have a user interface, and that its use requires programming skills related to Java and web services. This library best serves those programmers who have only a familiarity with JAXB—it can save them time from having to learn to configure JAXB for correctly generating objects from NIEM schema document sets.
* Discover the power of NIEM through real-world [success stories] (https://www.niem.gov/about-niem/success-stories).
