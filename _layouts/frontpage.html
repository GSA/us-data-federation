                <h2>What is federated data?</h2>
                <p class="usa-font-lead">Federated data refers to data aggregated from many entities across organizational boundaries (local, state, federal). </p>
                    
                <h2>What is a federated data effort?</h2>
                <p class="usa-font-lead">A federated data effort is an attempt to streamline and improve the collection of these data.  This might mean agreeing on a standard way to report data across organizations, or it might mean designing tools that make reading in and validating data in many different formats easier. </p>
                    
                <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
                <p class="usa-font-lead">Long term, successful federated data efforts are unlikely if the process by which data are collected, aggregated and validated cannot be improved.  Gathering these data in a timely fashion by using tools that are complementary to existing workflows (e.g. they do not add additional time and effort on the data provider) and that are easy to use will help modernize the way the federal government functions and interacts with other government agencies. </p>
